# makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a matrix containing a function to
# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of the inverse
# get the value of the inverse

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
# If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
# then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
# Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value in the cache via the setinverse function.
